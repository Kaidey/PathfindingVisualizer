# Pathfinding Visualizer 

React project meant to give the user a visualization of multiple pathfinding algorithms and (hopefully) a good medium to support the understanding of those algorithms . You can play with it on https://kaidey.github.io/pathfindingvisualizer/

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by Clement Mihailescu's (https://github.com/clementmihailescu) Pathfinding Visualizer thus the similarities that one might find between the two
